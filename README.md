# Team Profile Generator

This app is an employee profile generator for companies to keep track of their employees.
When the app is initiated, it will start by asking the information of the current manager.
Once that info is filled out, it will start a chain of questions where more employees can be
added to the team. Once the user is done inputing all of the cooresponding information, the
info is sent to an index.html file where it produces a page displaying each team member, their
subsequent role, and all of their information needed.
